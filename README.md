zbt-rush-app
============

microscope    : Sample app made via Meteor tutorial

taq_demo      : Sample app sort of replicating 6.470 TAQ.

google_meteor : Sample app for testing google maps API in conjunction with Meteor. Drivers
and rick side of it (INCOMPLETE)

rush_app      : Self-explanatory.



Branches:

master:

base_app: basically what we discussed yesterday at MV with Charles, Kyle, Jeffrey, Alan.
This means a ride queue and a driver-side of the app allowing him to indicate that
he has picked up/cannot find a rushee and the completion of a trip.

js-refactor:ignore for now. Some previous refactoring changes that were merged on
to base_app already.

activities: any changes, but focused on activities section of rush_app for now. 
Don't think will be of use in the near future, but has some code already.
